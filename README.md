# IMT2581 Solo Game Jam

## About

This is a group game jam for the course **IMT2581 Rapid Prototyping** done in 48 hours from **20.2.2021 18:00** to **22.2.2021 18:00** with the theme and restriction from [**Mini Jam 74**](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-74-chaos).

We decided to make a fighting game where the goal is to defeat the enemy in a bar. But the buttons for dodging and attacking change after each use, as well as there being a cooldown for dodging, making it harder to emerge victorious.

## Built With

This game was developed using the [Godot Engine v3.2.3](https://godotengine.org/) and the scripting language GDScript.
